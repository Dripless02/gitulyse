                <Text>
                    We collect information about contributors from GitHub, including the number of lines added, deleted, and commits made by each contributor, organized by month. Additionally, we calculate an average metric for each contributor, showing the average lines of code added or deleted per commit. Hence, we provide insights into individual activity and contributions over time.
