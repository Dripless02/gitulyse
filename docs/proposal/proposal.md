### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

### Achievements

<!-- > What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be? -->
The project will provide users with the ability to get more insight into what either their or another users contributions are to GitHub repositories. Users will also be able to produce a report of the contributions that can be used as a virtual GitHub CV or be used by employers to get a quick rundown of a candidate's contributions on GitHub.

The userbase for this project is very large, it can be used by management for insights on employees, it can be used by employers for insights on candidates and it can be used by personal users.


### Justification

<!-- > Why/when/where/how will it be useful? -->
This project can be useful to many different users. From a management perspective it can be used to look at an employees contributions for more insight on the work that the employee is doing. It can be used by an employer to look at a prospective candidate's open source contributions and gain greater insights into how the candidate works. And finally it can be used by personal users to either check their own or another person's contributions to repos and see how much work has been done in multiple timespans.

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

N/A

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

#### Student 1
