### Introduction

The project is a code reporting/summarizing tool which uses git functions such as "git webhooks", and the github api to parse information and metrics to a webapp/dashboard. The webapp/dashboard will display the information in a user friendly way. The project will be written in JavaScript and Python. The project will be useful for persons who want to see the progress of contributors to a git repository.

### Outline

The project will be a webapp/dashboard that will display information about a git repository. The information will parsed from git commits and will be display useful metrics such as the rate of contribution over time, deployment frequency, and change faliure rate, in a user friendly way as it is targeted to users who might not necessarily have an extensive programming background. The project will be written in JavaScript and Python. The project will be useful for persons who want to see the progress of contributors to a git repository.

### Background

The project idea came from the need of people in management postions to constantly monitor the progress of programmers in their team. During our INTRA placements we were constantly required to give updates on our progress and this was done by sending screenshots of our git commits and updating a seemingly never ending google sheet. This was not a very efficient way of displaying information as with bigger projects the spreadsheets could be quite daunting. So with this issue in mind we decided to create a tool that would automate this process to a certain degeree and display information in a more consise and user friendly manner. Other use cases that arose from this idea came from the fact that a user might want to track their own progress and have it up as a virtual portfolio.

### Achievements

<!-- > What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be? -->
The project will provide users with the ability to get more insight into what either their or another users contributions are to GitHub repositories. Users will also be able to produce a report of the contributions that can be used as a virtual GitHub CV or be used by employers to get a quick rundown of a candidate's contributions on GitHub.

The userbase for this project is very large, it can be used by management for insights on employees, it can be used by employers for insights on candidates and it can be used by personal users.


### Justification

<!-- > Why/when/where/how will it be useful? -->
This project can be useful to many different users. From a management perspective it can be used to look at an employees contributions for more insight on the work that the employee is doing. It can be used by an employer to look at a prospective candidate's open source contributions and gain greater insights into how the candidate works. And finally it can be used by personal users to either check their own or another person's contributions to repos and see how much work has been done in multiple timespans.

### Programming language(s)

<!-- > List the proposed language(s) to be used. -->

For our frontend we will be using JavaScript, and for the backend we will be using Python.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

<!-- > Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use. -->

For the frontend we will be using the React library. On the backend side we will be using Flask to create our REST API. The database we will be using is SQLite, this will making it easier for us to test the database locally, this could change in the long run to something like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### Hardware

N/A

### Learning Challenges

<!-- > List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn. -->

- Interaction with the GitHub API and parsing the data from it.
- Creating a backend using Flask in Python.
- Connecting our application to a SQLite database.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
