### Introduction

The project is a code reporting/summarizing tool which uses git functions such as "git webhooks", and the github api to parse information and metrics to a webapp/dashboard. The webapp/dashboard will display the information in a user friendly way. The project will be written in ___. The project will be useful for persons who want to see the progress of contributors to a git repository.

### Outline

The project will be a webapp/dashboard that will display information about a git repository. The information will parsed from git commits and will be display useful metrics such as the rate of contribution over time, deployment frequency, and change faliure rate, in a user friendly way as it is targeted to users who might not necessarily have an extensive programming background. The project will be written in ____. The project will be useful for persons who want to see the progress of contributors to a git repository.

### Background

The project idea came from the need of people in management postions to constantly monitor the progress of programmers in their team. During our INTRA placements we were constantly required to give updates on our progress and this was done by sending screenshots of our git commits and updating a seemingly never ending google sheet. This was not a very efficient way of displaying information as with bigger projects the spreadsheets could be quite daunting. So with this issue in mind we decided to create a tool that would automate this process to a certain degeree and display information in a more consise and user friendly manner. Other use cases that arose from this idea came from the fact that a user might want to track their own progress and have it up as a virtual portfolio.

### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
